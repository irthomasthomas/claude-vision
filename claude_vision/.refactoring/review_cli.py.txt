1. Improved type hinting: Added type hints to function parameters and return values for better code readability and maintainability.

2. Modularization: Extracted some functionality into separate functions (e.g., `parse_input_data`, `process_video`, `process_image`) to improve code organization and readability.

3. Error handling: Introduced a custom `ClaudeVisionError` exception for better error handling and reporting.

4. Async/await consistency: Ensured consistent use of async/await throughout the code.

5. Input parsing: Improved the input parsing logic by creating a separate function `parse_input_data`.

6. Output handling: Created separate functions for handling different output types (JSON, Markdown, text) to improve code organization.

7. Removed redundant code: Eliminated some repeated code blocks by creating reusable functions.

8. Improved naming: Used more descriptive variable and function names to enhance code readability.

9. Constants: Moved some hardcoded values to constants for better maintainability.

10. Comments: Added comments to explain complex parts of the code.

These changes make the code more modular, easier to read, and more maintainable. The error handling is improved, and the async nature of the code is more consistent. The refactored version should be easier to extend and debug in the future.
