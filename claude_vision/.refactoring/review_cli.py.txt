This refactored code aligns with the streamlined redesign plan and incorporates several improvements:

1. Simplified Command Structure: The CLI now has a single entry point (`claude-vision`) with subcommands for specific operations (analyze, compare, timeline, config).

2. Universal Persona System: The `PersonaManager` class is introduced to handle persona management and application across all operations.

3. Plugin Architecture: The `PluginManager` class is added to support plugin management and execution.

4. Configuration and Management: The `config` subcommand is implemented for managing settings, plugins, and personas.

5. Automatic Input Detection: The `detect_input_type` function is introduced to automatically determine whether the input is an image or video.

6. Modular Design: The code is organized into smaller, focused classes and functions, improving maintainability and extensibility.

7. Type Hints: Type annotations are used throughout the code to improve readability and catch type-related errors early.

8. Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling for unsupported input types and other potential issues.

9. Flexibility: The CLI supports various output formats (json, text) and allows for persona specification in all relevant commands.

To complete the implementation, you'll need to:

1. Implement the `PersonaManager`, `PluginManager`, `Config`, and `input_detector` modules.
2. Develop the `process_image` and `process_video` functions in their respective modules.
3. Implement the comparison and timeline analysis logic in the `_compare_inputs` and `_analyze_timeline` methods.
4. Add more robust error handling and input validation.
5. Implement the plugin system to allow for extending CLI functionality.
6. Create comprehensive documentation and examples for users and plugin developers.

This refactored structure provides a solid foundation for the Claude Vision CLI, aligning with the goals of simplicity, flexibility, and universal persona integration.
