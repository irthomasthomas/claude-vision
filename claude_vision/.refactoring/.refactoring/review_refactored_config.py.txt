The refactored code includes the following improvements:

1. Error Handling: Added more specific error handling for file operations and YAML parsing.

2. Path Handling: Used `pathlib.Path` for better cross-platform path handling.

3. Type Hinting: Improved type hinting throughout the code.

4. Initialization: Created an `initialize_config()` function to encapsulate the initialization process.

5. Default Values: Used `field(default_factory=lambda: ...)` for mutable default values in the `Config` dataclass.

6. File Operations: Used `read_text()` and `write_text()` methods for file I/O, which are more concise and handle file closing automatically.

7. Directory Creation: Used `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` for more robust directory creation.

8. Constants: Moved the configuration file path to a class method, making it easier to change or override in subclasses.

9. Modularity: The `ConfigManager` class is now more self-contained and easier to use in other parts of the application.

These changes make the code more robust, easier to maintain, and more aligned with Python best practices.
