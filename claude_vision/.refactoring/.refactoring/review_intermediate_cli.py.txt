The refactored code includes several improvements:

1. Consistent error handling: All commands now handle both `ClaudeVisionError` and general exceptions, providing better error reporting.

2. Type hints: Added type hints throughout the code for better clarity and IDE support.

3. Modularization: Extracted common functionality into separate functions and decorators (e.g., `persona_command`).

4. Async/await consistency: Ensured all functions that could be asynchronous are properly defined with `async def`.

5. Improved command structure: Organized commands into groups (e.g., `persona`, `config`) for better CLI structure.

6. Use of TypedDict: Introduced `ContextObject` and `PersonaData` as TypedDict classes for better type checking of dictionary structures.

7. Constants: Moved output formats to a constant `OUTPUT_FORMATS` for easier maintenance.

8. Docstrings: Added or improved docstrings for all functions to provide better documentation.

9. Simplified imports: Organized imports at the top of the file, grouping them by source.

10. Consistent naming: Used consistent naming conventions throughout the code.

These changes make the code more robust, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors. The improved error handling and type hinting will make debugging easier, while the modular structure allows for easier extension of functionality in the future.
