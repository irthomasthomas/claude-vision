1. Code Structure: The code has been reorganized into classes (JSONSchemas, JSONValidator, JSONParser, JSONFormatter) for better organization and modularity.

2. Type Annotations: Added type hints to improve code clarity and enable better IDE support.

3. Error Handling: Consolidated error handling in the JSONValidator class, making it easier to manage and update validation logic.

4. DRY Principle: Removed duplicate code by creating reusable methods like validate_schema.

5. Naming Conventions: Improved naming for better clarity (e.g., JSONSchemas instead of separate schema variables).

6. Consistency: Standardized the way JSON parsing and validation are handled across different functions.

7. Modularity: The new structure allows for easier extension and modification of individual components.

8. Reduced Complexity: Broke down larger functions into smaller, more focused methods (e.g., _format_frame_result in JSONFormatter).

9. Constants: Moved schema definitions into a separate class, making them easier to manage and update.

10. Flexibility: The new structure allows for easier addition of new schemas or parsing methods in the future.

This refactored version improves the overall code quality, making it more maintainable, readable, and extensible.
