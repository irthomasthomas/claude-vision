1. Improved type hints: Added more specific type hints using TypedDict for VideoMetadata and FrameData.

2. Enum for video extensions: Created a VideoExtension enum for better type safety when checking file extensions.

3. Error handling: Added try-except blocks in functions to catch and raise more informative exceptions.

4. Consistency in return types: Ensured all functions return consistent types, especially for extract_frames.

5. GPU initialization: Added a warning message if GPU initialization fails, instead of silently failing.

6. Code structure: Kept the overall structure similar but improved readability with better type hints and error handling.

7. Variable naming: Kept variable names consistent and descriptive.

8. Comments: Removed unnecessary comments as the code is now more self-explanatory with improved type hints.

9. Video file opening: Added checks to ensure the video file is successfully opened before proceeding.

10. Performance: The core logic for frame extraction remains efficient, using ProcessPoolExecutor for parallel processing.

These changes make the code more robust, easier to maintain, and less prone to runtime errors. The improved type hints also make it easier for developers to understand and use the functions correctly.
