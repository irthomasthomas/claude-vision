Here's a refactored version of the code with improved organization and structure:

</REFACTORED_CODE>

<REVIEW>
1. Improved organization: The imports are now grouped more clearly by their respective modules.

2. Type hints: Added type hints for better code clarity and to catch potential type-related errors early.

3. Categorization: Created separate lists for each category of imports (IMAGE_PROCESSING, CLAUDE_INTEGRATION, etc.). This makes it easier to manage and update the __all__ list.

4. Modular __all__ list: The __all__ list is now constructed by combining the category lists. This makes it easier to maintain and ensures that all imported items are included.

5. Consistency: Maintained the existing import structure while improving its organization.

6. Readability: The new structure makes it easier to understand what each imported item is used for.

7. Extensibility: Adding new items to a category is now as simple as adding them to the appropriate list.

This refactored version improves the code's organization and maintainability while preserving its functionality. It's now easier to add new imports or remove existing ones, and the categorization provides a clearer overview of the module's contents.
