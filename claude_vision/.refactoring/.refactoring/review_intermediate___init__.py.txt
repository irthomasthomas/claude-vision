1. Type Annotations: Added type hints to improve code clarity and enable better static type checking.

2. Configuration Handling: Instead of importing individual configuration values, we now import the Config class. This allows for better encapsulation and easier management of configuration values.

3. Configuration Initialization: Added a section to initialize the configuration and make its values available at the module level. This provides a clear separation between imports and configuration setup.

4. Consistent Naming: Changed 'Configuration' comment to 'Config' to match the actual import.

5. Import Order: Kept the imports grouped by functionality, which is good for readability.

6. __all__ Definition: Added a type annotation for the __all__ list, improving type safety.

These changes further improve the code's structure, type safety, and maintainability. The use of a Config class allows for more flexible configuration management, while keeping the individual configuration values easily accessible at the module level.
