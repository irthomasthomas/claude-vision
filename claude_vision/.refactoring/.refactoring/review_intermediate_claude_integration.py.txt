This refactored version introduces several improvements:

1. Enhanced Type Hinting: Added more specific type hints, including the use of TypeVar for generic type annotations.

2. Docstrings: Added detailed docstrings to functions, improving code readability and maintainability.

3. Error Handling: Introduced a custom StreamParseError for handling stream parsing errors.

4. Enum for Image Media Types: Added an ImageMediaType enum for better type safety when specifying image formats.

5. Function Separation: Further separated concerns by creating distinct functions for stream and non-stream response handling.

6. Improved Naming: Used more descriptive names for some variables and functions.

7. Logger Configuration: Added a placeholder function for configuring the logger, which can be customized as needed.

8. Constants: Kept the use of constants for configuration values, improving maintainability.

9. Consistent Formatting: Ensured consistent formatting throughout the code.

10. Error Messages: Maintained improved error messages with HTTP status codes.

These changes enhance the code's robustness, readability, and maintainability while preserving its core functionality. The added type hints and docstrings make the code more self-documenting and easier for other developers to understand and use.
