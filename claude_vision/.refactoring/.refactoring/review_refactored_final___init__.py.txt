This refactored version introduces several improvements:

1. Type Annotations: Added type hints for better code clarity and to catch potential type-related errors early.

2. Categorization: Introduced separate lists for each category of imports (IMAGE_PROCESSING, CLAUDE_INTEGRATION, etc.). This makes it easier to manage and understand the structure of the module.

3. Dynamic __all__ Generation: Instead of manually listing all items in __all__, it's now generated by combining all the category lists. This reduces the chance of errors when adding or removing items.

4. Improved Readability: The categorized lists provide a clear overview of what's included in each section of the module.

5. Easier Maintenance: Adding or removing items from a specific category is now more straightforward, as you only need to modify the relevant category list.

6. Consistency: The format for imports and list definitions is now more consistent throughout the file.

7. Scalability: This structure makes it easier to add new categories or reorganize existing ones as the project grows.

These changes make the code more organized, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors when updating the list of exported names. It also provides a clearer structure for developers working on the project.
