This refactored version includes several improvements:

1. Data Classes: Introduced `VideoMetadata` and `FrameData` classes to improve type safety and code readability.

2. Improved Type Hints: Enhanced type annotations throughout the code.

3. Error Handling: While not explicitly added, the use of data classes and type hints can help catch potential errors earlier.

4. Modularization: Separated frame reading and processing into a `read_and_process_frame` function for better organization.

5. List Comprehension: Used list comprehension in `extract_frames` for more concise code.

6. Consistency: Maintained consistent naming conventions and code style.

7. Optional Parameters: Kept the use of `Optional` type for `num_workers`.

8. Main Guard: Retained the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard for proper script execution.

9. Context Managers: Continued use of context managers for resource management.

10. GPU Initialization: Kept the separate `initialize_gpu` function.

These changes enhance code readability, maintainability, and type safety while preserving the core functionality. The structure is now more modular and easier to extend or modify in the future.
