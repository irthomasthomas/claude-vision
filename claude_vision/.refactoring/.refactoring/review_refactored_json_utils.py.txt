1. Code Structure: The code is now organized into clear, distinct classes with well-defined responsibilities.

2. Error Handling: Introduced a custom `JSONSchemaError` for more specific error handling related to schema validation.

3. DRY Principle: Removed duplicate code by creating a generic `parse_json` method in the `JSONParser` class.

4. Type Hints: Improved and consistent use of type hints throughout the code for better clarity and IDE support.

5. Method Refactoring: Extracted common logic into separate methods (e.g., `_parse_result` in `JSONFormatter`) to improve readability and maintainability.

6. Consistency: Standardized the way JSON parsing and validation are handled across different functions.

7. Modularity: The new structure allows for easier extension and modification of individual components.

8. Naming Conventions: Improved naming for better clarity and consistency (e.g., `parse_json` instead of `parse_json_input`).

9. Comments: Added a docstring for the custom exception class to explain its purpose.

10. Flexibility: The refactored code is more flexible and can easily accommodate new schemas or parsing methods in the future.

These changes make the code more robust, easier to read, and more maintainable while preserving the original functionality.
