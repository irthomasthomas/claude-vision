This refactored version introduces several improvements:

1. Error Handling: Custom exceptions (ConfigError and ConfigLoadError) have been added for more specific error handling.

2. Type Annotations: More comprehensive type hints have been added throughout the code.

3. Robustness: The code now handles cases where the config file doesn't exist more gracefully.

4. Separation of Concerns: An `initialize_config` function has been added to handle the initialization process, improving modularity.

5. Error Reporting: More informative error messages are now provided when exceptions occur.

6. Fail-safe Mechanism: If configuration loading fails, the code falls back to default configuration and continues execution.

7. Consistent Style: The code now follows a more consistent style, improving readability.

8. Encapsulation: The Config dataclass and ConfigManager class maintain their structure, preserving the benefits of the previous refactoring.

These changes make the code more robust, easier to debug, and more maintainable. The error handling improvements ensure that the application can continue running with default settings even if configuration loading fails, providing a better user experience.
