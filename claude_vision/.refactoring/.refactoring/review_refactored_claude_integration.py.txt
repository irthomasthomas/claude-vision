This refactored version includes several improvements:

1. Enhanced Type Hinting: More precise type hints are used throughout the code, including the use of TypeVar for generic type annotations.

2. Improved Error Handling: A new `StreamParseError` exception is introduced to handle parsing errors in streamed responses.

3. Better Code Structure: Functions are organized more logically, with clear separations between different responsibilities.

4. Docstrings: Comprehensive docstrings are added to functions, providing clear explanations of their purpose, parameters, and return values.

5. Enum for Image Media Types: A new `ImageMediaType` enum is introduced to standardize image media type strings.

6. Consistent Naming: Function and variable names are more consistent and descriptive.

7. Error Logging: More detailed error logging is implemented, especially for stream parsing errors.

8. Configuration Function: A `configure_logger` function is added as a placeholder for custom logger configuration.

9. Generic Error Handling: The `handle_api_errors` decorator now uses a generic type, making it more flexible and type-safe.

10. Constants: All constant values are clearly defined at the top of the file for easy reference and modification.

These changes make the code more robust, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors. The improved type hinting and docstrings also make the code more self-documenting and easier for other developers to understand and use.
