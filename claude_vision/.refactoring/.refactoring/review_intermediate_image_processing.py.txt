1. Improved Error Handling:
   - Added a new `ImageProcessingError` exception for more specific error handling.
   - Used exception chaining (`raise ... from e`) to preserve the original exception context.

2. Enhanced Type Hinting:
   - Added more specific type hints, including for the `max_images` parameter in `process_multiple_images`.

3. Code Organization:
   - Grouped imports by standard library, third-party, and local imports.
   - Kept the `ImageSource` enum and `ProcessedImage` dataclass at the top for better visibility.

4. Consistency:
   - Ensured consistent use of f-strings for string formatting.

5. Flexibility:
   - Made the `max_images` limit in `process_multiple_images` a parameter with a default value, allowing for easier customization.

6. Documentation:
   - While not added in this refactor, it would be beneficial to add docstrings to functions for better documentation.

7. Error Logging:
   - Maintained comprehensive error logging throughout the code.

8. Performance:
   - The asynchronous structure for processing multiple images is preserved, allowing for efficient parallel processing.

This refactored version maintains the core functionality while improving error handling, type safety, and code organization. It provides a more robust and maintainable structure for image processing tasks.
