This refactored version includes several improvements:

1. Enhanced Type Hinting: More comprehensive type annotations, including the use of dataclasses for better structure.

2. Error Handling: Introduced a custom `VideoProcessingError` for more specific error reporting.

3. Modularization: Further broke down the `process_video_frames` function into smaller, more focused functions.

4. Dataclasses: Used dataclasses (`VideoAnalysisResult` and `FrameAnalysisParams`) to group related data and improve code readability.

5. Asynchronous Processing: Maintained and improved the asynchronous nature of the code, ensuring efficient processing of video frames.

6. Flexibility: Added a `batch_size` parameter to `analyze_video` for more control over processing.

7. Consistent Naming: Improved naming conventions for better code clarity.

8. Reduced Duplication: Extracted common logic into separate functions to reduce code duplication.

9. Encapsulation: Moved some of the internal logic into private functions (prefixed with underscore) to better encapsulate the implementation details.

These changes make the code more robust, easier to maintain, and more flexible for future extensions. The error handling has been improved, and the overall structure is cleaner and more modular.
