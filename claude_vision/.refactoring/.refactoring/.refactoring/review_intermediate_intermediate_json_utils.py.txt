This refactored code addresses the requirements and improves the structure and maintainability of the claude_vision package. Here are the key changes and improvements:

1. CLI Restructuring:
   - The CLI structure has been simplified to three main commands: analyze, config, and persona.
   - The 'analyze' command now combines --video and --frame-interval into a single --video option.
   - The 'group' option has been removed as it's now the default behavior.
   - A new 'persona' command has been added to manage personas.

2. Error Handling:
   - A global exception handler for ClaudeVisionError has been implemented in the analyze command.
   - Specific error handling has been added to the persona command.

3. Circular Import Resolution:
   - A new core.py file is assumed to contain shared functionality, reducing circular imports.
   - Imports have been updated to use core.py for shared functions and classes.

4. Configuration Updates:
   - A Configuration class is now used instead of global variables.
   - The config command has been updated to use this new class.

5. Alt-Text Generation:
   - The separate alt_text command has been removed.
   - Alt-text generation can now be handled as a persona in the analyze command.

6. Persona Implementation:
   - A new persona.py file is assumed to handle persona-related functionality.
   - The persona command now supports adding, editing, listing, and deleting personas.

7. Code Organization:
   - The code has been restructured for better readability and maintainability.
   - Async functions have been separated and organized more logically.

8. Type Hints and Docstrings:
   - Type hints have been added or updated where appropriate.
   - Docstrings should be added to all new functions and classes (not shown in this refactored version due to space constraints).

This refactored version provides a more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly structure for the claude_vision package. It addresses the circular import issues, improves error handling, and provides a more flexible way to manage personas and configurations.
