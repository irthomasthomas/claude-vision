This refactored version builds upon your improvements and adds the following enhancements:

1. Error Code Property: Added an `error_code` property to the `AnthropicError` class, which returns the name of the error type. This can be useful for programmatic error handling.

2. Dynamic Error Class Creation: Introduced a `create_error_class` factory function that dynamically creates error classes. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to add new error types in the future.

3. Consistent Naming: The error class names are now automatically generated from the enum names, ensuring consistency and reducing the chance of typos.

4. Reduced Boilerplate: By using the factory function, we've eliminated the need for individual class definitions for each error type, making the code more concise and easier to maintain.

5. Flexibility: This structure makes it trivial to add new error types - simply add a new entry to the `AnthropicErrorType` enum, and the corresponding error class will be automatically created.

These additional changes further improve the extensibility and maintainability of the error handling system while preserving all the benefits of your initial refactoring.
