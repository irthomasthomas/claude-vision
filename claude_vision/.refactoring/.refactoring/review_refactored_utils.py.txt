This refactored version introduces several improvements:

1. Enum for Log Levels: A `LogLevel` enum is introduced to provide type-safe log level selection.

2. Configuration Dataclass: A `LoggerConfig` dataclass is used to encapsulate all logger configuration options, making it easier to create custom configurations.

3. Renamed Main Class: The `LoggerSetup` class is renamed to `Logger` for clarity.

4. Improved Configurability: The `_setup_logging` method now takes a `LoggerConfig` object, allowing for easy customization of all logger parameters.

5. Type Hints: Improved type hinting throughout the code for better clarity and IDE support.

6. Default Configuration: A default configuration is provided, but can be easily overridden.

7. Usage Examples: Added comments showing how to use the default logger and how to create a custom configured logger.

8. Singleton Pattern: Maintained the singleton pattern to ensure only one logger instance is created.

These changes make the code more flexible, easier to maintain, and more aligned with Python best practices. The logging setup can now be easily customized without modifying the core implementation.
