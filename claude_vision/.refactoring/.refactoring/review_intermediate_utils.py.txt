This refactored version includes the following improvements:

1. Configuration: Log file path, log format, and log levels are now class variables, making them easier to modify and potentially load from a configuration file.

2. Environment Variable: The log file path can be set using an environment variable, providing more flexibility.

3. Error Handling: Added a try-except block for file handler creation to handle potential IOErrors.

4. Separate Methods: File and console handler setup are now in separate methods, improving readability and maintainability.

5. Flexible Naming: The `get_logger` function now accepts a name parameter, allowing for more specific logger names when needed.

6. Path Handling: Using `pathlib.Path` for better cross-platform compatibility when handling file paths.

7. Type Hinting: Maintained and improved type hinting throughout the code.

8. Encapsulation: All logger setup logic is encapsulated within the `LoggerSetup` class, with a simple `get_logger` function for easy access.

This version maintains the benefits of the previous refactor while addressing its limitations and adding more flexibility and robustness to the logging setup.
