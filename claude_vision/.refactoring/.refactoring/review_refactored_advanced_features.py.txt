1. Improved Structure: The code now uses a class `ImageAnalyzer` to group related methods, improving organization and readability.

2. Error Handling: Added an `InvalidPersonaError` for better error handling in the `persona_based_analysis` method.

3. Type Hinting: Improved type hints throughout the code, including the use of `Optional` for nullable fields.

4. Method Extraction: Extracted prompt creation into separate methods, improving readability and maintainability.

5. Consistent Naming: Used more consistent method names (e.g., `_create_*_prompt`) for better clarity.

6. Reduced Duplication: The `_perform_analysis` method is now shared across all analysis types, reducing code duplication.

7. Improved Flexibility: The `_create_final_prompt` method allows for easy modification of the final prompt structure.

8. Enum Usage: Kept the `OutputType` enum for type-safe output format selection.

9. Dataclass Usage: Maintained the use of the `AnalysisParams` dataclass for structured parameter passing.

These changes make the code more modular, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors. The class-based structure also allows for easier extension of functionality in the future.
