This refactored version introduces several improvements and new features:

1. Unified Interface: The `AdvancedAnalysis` class now provides a single entry point (`perform` method) for all analysis types, making it easier to use and extend.

2. Enum for Analysis Types: An `AnalysisType` enum is introduced to standardize and validate analysis types.

3. Error Handling: Added `InvalidAnalysisTypeError` to handle cases where an invalid analysis type is requested.

4. Improved Modularity: Each analysis function is now a static method within the `AdvancedAnalysis` class, improving organization and maintainability.

5. Consistent Naming: Method names now consistently use underscore prefixes for "private" methods.

6. Flexible Parameter Handling: The `perform` method uses `**kwargs` to allow for flexible parameter passing to different analysis types.

7. Type Hinting: Maintained and improved type hinting throughout the code.

8. Optional Parameters: Used `Optional` type for parameters that may be None.

9. Cleaner User Prompt Handling: The user prompt is now added on a new line for better separation from the base prompt.

These changes make the code more robust, easier to maintain, and more extensible. The unified interface allows for easier addition of new analysis types in the future, while the use of enums and improved error handling enhances type safety and user experience.
