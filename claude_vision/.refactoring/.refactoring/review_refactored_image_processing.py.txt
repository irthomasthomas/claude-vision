1. Code Organization: The code has been reorganized into a class `ImageProcessor`, which encapsulates all image processing methods. This improves code structure and readability.

2. Type Hinting: Improved type hinting throughout the code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

3. Error Handling: Maintained existing error handling and logging, ensuring robust error reporting.

4. Asynchronous Operations: Kept the asynchronous nature of the code, allowing for efficient processing of multiple images.

5. Enum Usage: Continued use of the `ImageSource` enum for clear categorization of image types.

6. Method Refactoring: The `get_image` method has been refactored to use a dictionary of handlers, making it more extensible and easier to maintain.

7. Constants: Kept the use of constants from the config file (MAX_IMAGE_SIZE, SUPPORTED_FORMATS).

8. Docstrings: While not added in this refactor, it would be beneficial to add docstrings to methods for better documentation.

9. Static Methods: Used static methods where appropriate, improving code organization within the class.

This refactored version provides a more modular and maintainable structure while preserving the functionality of the original code. It's now easier to extend with new image processing capabilities if needed.
