This refactored version of the code introduces several improvements:

1. Encapsulation: The configuration is now encapsulated in a `Config` dataclass, making it easier to manage and extend.

2. Separation of Concerns: The `ConfigManager` class handles all operations related to loading, saving, and managing the configuration, improving modularity.

3. Type Hinting: The code now uses proper type hints throughout, enhancing readability and allowing for better static type checking.

4. Simplified YAML Handling: The custom YAML loader has been removed in favor of the built-in `safe_load` function, which is generally safer and simpler to use.

5. Improved Error Handling: The code now prints an error message if there's an issue loading the config file, instead of silently failing.

6. Flexibility: The `_update_config` method allows for partial updates of the configuration, maintaining default values for missing keys.

7. Single Responsibility: Each method in the `ConfigManager` class has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

8. Initialization: The configuration is now initialized in a more streamlined manner at the end of the file.

These changes make the code more robust, easier to maintain, and more aligned with Python best practices and object-oriented programming principles.
