1. Improved organization: The imports are now grouped by their respective modules, making it easier to understand the structure of the project.

2. Added comments: Each group of imports now has a comment indicating which module they come from, improving readability.

3. Consistent formatting: The imports and __all__ list are now consistently formatted, with one item per line.

4. Logical ordering: The __all__ list is now ordered to match the import groups, making it easier to maintain and update.

5. Removed redundant imports: The code no longer imports from itself (e.g., removed 'from .claude_integration import claude_vision_analysis' at the beginning).

6. Simplified structure: The overall structure is now cleaner and more modular, making it easier to manage and extend the codebase.

This refactored version improves the organization and readability of the code while maintaining all the original functionality. It also makes it easier for other developers to understand the structure of the project and locate specific components.
