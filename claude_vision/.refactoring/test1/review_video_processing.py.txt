The refactored code includes the following improvements:

1. Added type hints to improve code readability and catch potential type-related errors.
2. Created custom classes (VideoFrame and VideoAnalysisResult) to encapsulate frame and result data, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.
3. Used an Enum for OutputType to ensure type safety when specifying output formats.
4. Improved error handling by wrapping the main functions in try-except blocks and raising a custom VideoProcessingError when exceptions occur.
5. Restructured the process_video_frames function to return a list of VideoAnalysisResult objects, making the return type consistent and easier to work with.
6. Removed the TODO comment and implemented the requested features (analyzing frames independently or as a group, supporting custom prompts and system messages).
7. Simplified the analyze_video function by using list comprehension to create VideoFrame objects.
8. Made the code more modular by separating the frame processing logic into its own function.

These changes improve the overall structure, maintainability, and type safety of the code while implementing the requested features.
