This refactored code improves the structure and maintainability of the configuration module:

1. We've created a `Configuration` class using `dataclass` to encapsulate all configuration settings. This provides better type hinting and makes the code more organized.

2. The `CustomLoader` and `construct_python_tuple` functions have been removed as they're no longer necessary. We're using `yaml.safe_load()` instead, which is more secure and doesn't require custom constructors.

3. All configuration-related methods are now part of the `Configuration` class, making it easier to manage and extend functionality.

4. We've added methods for managing personas (`add_persona`, `edit_persona`, `delete_persona`, `get_persona`, `list_personas`) as requested.

5. The "alt-text" persona has been added to the `DEFAULT_PERSONAS` dictionary.

6. The global variables have been replaced with class attributes, which are more manageable and less prone to unintended modifications.

7. The `load` method now returns a `Configuration` instance, making it easier to work with the configuration in other parts of the code.

8. The `save` method now uses `asdict()` to convert the dataclass to a dictionary before saving, ensuring all attributes are properly saved.

This refactored code provides a more robust and extensible configuration management system for the Claude Vision package.
