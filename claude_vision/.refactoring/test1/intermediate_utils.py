Here's a refactored version of the logging setup code:

<REFACTORED_CODE>
import logging
from typing import Optional

class LoggerSetup:
    @staticmethod
    def configure(log_level: int = logging.DEBUG,
                  log_file: str = "claude_vision_debug.log",
                  file_mode: str = "w") -> logging.Logger:
        """
        Configure and return a logger with specified settings.

        Args:
            log_level (int): The logging level (e.g., logging.DEBUG, logging.INFO)
            log_file (str): The name of the log file
            file_mode (str): The file mode for logging ('w' for write, 'a' for append)

        Returns:
            logging.Logger: Configured logger instance
        """
        logging.basicConfig(level=log_level, 
                            filename=log_file, 
                            filemode=file_mode,
                            format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
        return logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Create a global logger instance
logger: Optional[logging.Logger] = None

def get_logger() -> logging.Logger:
    """
    Get or create the global logger instance.

    Returns:
        logging.Logger: The configured logger instance
    """
    global logger
    if logger is None:
        logger = LoggerSetup.configure()
    return logger
</REFACTORED_CODE>

<REVIEW>
This refactored version offers several improvements:

1. Encapsulation: The logging setup is encapsulated in a `LoggerSetup` class, making it easier to manage and potentially extend in the future.

2. Flexibility: The `configure` method allows for customization of log level, file name, and file mode, making it more flexible for different use cases.

3. Singleton pattern: The `get_logger` function implements a simple singleton pattern, ensuring that only one logger instance is created and reused throughout the application.

4. Type hinting: Type hints have been added to improve code readability and enable better IDE support.

5. Docstrings: Comprehensive docstrings have been added to explain the purpose and usage of each function.

6. Formatting: The logger now includes a timestamp, logger name, and log level in each message, which can be helpful for debugging.

To use this refactored code, you would typically import and use the logger like this:

```python
from .utils import get_logger

logger = get_logger()
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
```

This approach provides a more robust and flexible logging setup for the Claude Vision package.
