This refactored code aligns with the streamlined redesign plan and incorporates several improvements:

1. Simplified Structure: The code is now organized into a `ClaudeVisionAPI` class, making it easier to manage and extend.

2. Configuration Integration: The class now uses a `Configuration` object, allowing for easier management of settings.

3. Improved Error Handling: All custom exceptions now inherit from `ClaudeVisionError`, providing a consistent error hierarchy.

4. Type Safety: Enum classes are used for `OutputType`, `HttpStatusCode`, and `ImageMediaType`, improving type safety.

5. Flexibility: The `RequestData` dataclass makes it easier to modify request structures in the future.

6. Readability: Type hints and docstrings have been added to all methods, improving code readability and documentation.

7. Modularity: Functions have been broken down into smaller, more focused methods, improving maintainability.

8. Configurability: The class now uses configuration values for API URL, key, version, and other settings, making it more flexible.

9. Logging: The code now uses a centralized logger from the `utils` module.

This refactored version provides a more robust, maintainable, and extensible structure for the Claude Vision integration. It allows for easier future modifications and aligns with the goal of creating a flexible, powerful CLI with universal persona integration.
