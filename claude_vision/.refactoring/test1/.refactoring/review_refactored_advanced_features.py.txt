This refactored code improves the structure and maintainability of the claude_vision package by:

1. Using an Enum for analysis types, making it easier to add new types in the future.
2. Creating dataclasses for different analysis parameters, improving type safety and readability.
3. Implementing a single entry point `analyze_images` function that handles all analysis types.
4. Improving error handling by wrapping all analysis functions in a try-except block and raising a custom `ClaudeVisionError`.
5. Removing duplicate code by extracting common functionality into separate functions.
6. Using type hints consistently throughout the code.
7. Updating the `persona_based_analysis` function to use the new `Configuration` class for managing personas.
8. Simplifying the `generate_alt_text` function to use the same parameter structure as other analysis types.

These changes make the code more modular, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors. It also provides a clearer structure for adding new analysis types in the future.
