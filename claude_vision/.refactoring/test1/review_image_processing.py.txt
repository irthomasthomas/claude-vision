The refactored code improves the structure, readability, and maintainability of the image processing module. Here are the key changes and improvements:

1. Created an `ImageProcessor` class to encapsulate all image processing methods, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.

2. Introduced an `ImageSource` enum to better categorize and handle different types of image sources.

3. Improved error handling by introducing a new `ImageProcessingError` exception for image-specific errors.

4. Enhanced type annotations throughout the code for better type checking and IDE support.

5. Moved configuration parameters (max_size, supported_formats, max_images) to the class initialization, allowing for easier configuration management.

6. Split the `process_image_source` method into smaller, more focused methods (`_get_image_from_source`, `_determine_source_type`, `_prepare_image`) for better readability and maintainability.

7. Removed the `process_as_group` parameter from `process_multiple_images` as it wasn't being used in the original implementation.

8. Updated method names to be more descriptive and consistent (e.g., `open_image` instead of `open_image_file`).

9. Improved logging messages for better debugging and error tracking.

These changes make the code more modular, easier to understand, and simpler to extend or modify in the future. The use of a class structure also allows for better encapsulation of related functionality and easier testing.
