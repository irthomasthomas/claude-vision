<REVIEW>
This refactored code addresses the following improvements:

1. Circular imports are resolved by introducing a new `core.py` file that contains all shared functionality.
2. The `Configuration` class is used instead of global variables for better encapsulation and management of settings.
3. The base exception `ClaudeVisionError` is introduced, and all custom exceptions now inherit from it.
4. The `generate_alt_text` function is removed from the advanced features, as it will be implemented as a built-in persona.
5. The imports are organized more clearly, with all functionality coming from the `core.py` file.
6. The `CONFIGURATION` category now includes the `config` object instead of individual configuration variables.
7. The code structure is more modular and easier to maintain.

These changes improve the overall structure of the package, make it easier to manage dependencies, and provide a more consistent approach to error handling and configuration management.
