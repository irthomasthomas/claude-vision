The refactored code improves upon the original in several ways:

1. Improved organization: The code is now structured into logical classes and functions, making it easier to understand and maintain.

2. Type hints: Added type hints to function parameters and return values, improving code readability and allowing for better static type checking.

3. Enums and dataclasses: Introduced AnalysisType enum and InputSchema/OutputSchema dataclasses to provide better type safety and reduce string literal usage.

4. Consistent naming: Adopted a more consistent naming convention for variables and functions.

5. Reduced code duplication: Created a JsonSchemaValidator class and JsonParser class to handle common JSON parsing and validation tasks.

6. Improved error handling: Standardized error handling for JSON parsing and schema validation.

7. Constants: Moved schema definitions into constants, making them easier to maintain and update.

8. Modularity: The refactored code is more modular, with clear separation of concerns between different functions and classes.

These changes make the code more robust, easier to understand, and simpler to extend in the future. The use of type hints and enums also helps catch potential errors earlier in the development process.
