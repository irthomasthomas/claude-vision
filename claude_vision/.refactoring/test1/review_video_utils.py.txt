The refactored code includes the following improvements:

1. Type hints have been added to improve code readability and catch potential type-related errors.
2. Custom exceptions (VideoProcessingError) have been introduced for better error handling.
3. Dataclasses (VideoMetadata and FrameData) have been used to represent structured data, improving code clarity.
4. Functions have been reorganized and given more descriptive names.
5. Comments have been added to explain the purpose of each function.
6. The GPU initialization has been moved to a separate function and is called at module import.
7. Error checking has been added when opening video files.
8. The code now uses a set for video extensions, which is more efficient for lookups.
9. The save_frames function now converts RGB frames back to BGR before saving, ensuring correct color representation.

These changes make the code more robust, easier to read, and more maintainable. The use of type hints and custom exceptions will help catch errors earlier in the development process.
