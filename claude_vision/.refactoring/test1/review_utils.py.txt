This refactored version offers several improvements:

1. Encapsulation: The logging setup is encapsulated in a `LoggerSetup` class, making it easier to manage and potentially extend in the future.

2. Flexibility: The `configure` method allows for customization of log level, file name, and file mode, making it more flexible for different use cases.

3. Singleton pattern: The `get_logger` function implements a simple singleton pattern, ensuring that only one logger instance is created and reused throughout the application.

4. Type hinting: Type hints have been added to improve code readability and enable better IDE support.

5. Docstrings: Comprehensive docstrings have been added to explain the purpose and usage of each function.

6. Formatting: The logger now includes a timestamp, logger name, and log level in each message, which can be helpful for debugging.

To use this refactored code, you would typically import and use the logger like this:

```python
from .utils import get_logger

logger = get_logger()
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
```

This approach provides a more robust and flexible logging setup for the Claude Vision package.
