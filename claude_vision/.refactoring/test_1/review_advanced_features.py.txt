The refactored code introduces several improvements:

1. Consistent Structure: All analysis functions now follow a similar pattern, making the code more uniform and easier to maintain.

2. Enum for Output Type: An OutputType enum is introduced to standardize and validate output types.

3. AnalysisParams Dataclass: A dataclass is used to encapsulate common parameters across all analysis functions, reducing parameter bloat and improving readability.

4. Helper Function: The _perform_analysis function encapsulates common logic for all analysis types, reducing code duplication.

5. Type Hinting: Improved type hinting throughout the code enhances clarity and helps catch potential type-related errors early.

6. String Formatting: Multi-line f-strings are used for better readability of complex prompts.

7. Naming Consistency: Function and variable names are more consistent, improving overall code coherence.

8. Removed Redundant Comments: Unnecessary comments were removed, relying on clear function names and type hints to convey meaning.

These changes make the code more modular, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors. The use of dataclasses and enums also makes it easier to extend the functionality in the future.
