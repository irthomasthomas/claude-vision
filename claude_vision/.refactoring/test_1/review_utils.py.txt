1. Singleton Pattern: The refactored code uses a singleton pattern through the `LoggerSetup` class. This ensures that only one logger instance is created and reused throughout the application.

2. Separation of Concerns: The logging setup is encapsulated within the `LoggerSetup` class, making it easier to maintain and modify logging configurations.

3. Multiple Handlers: The refactored code adds both a file handler and a console handler. This allows for logging to a file (with DEBUG level) and to the console (with INFO level), providing more flexibility in log management.

4. Type Hinting: The code now includes type hints, improving readability and allowing for better IDE support and type checking.

5. Customizable Formatter: A formatter is added to both handlers, which can be easily customized to change the log message format.

6. Constants: The log filename is still hardcoded. In a larger application, you might want to move this to a configuration file or environment variable.

7. Error Handling: The code doesn't include explicit error handling for file operations. In a production environment, you might want to add try-except blocks to handle potential IOErrors when creating the file handler.

8. Flexibility: The `get_logger` method allows for easy retrieval of the logger instance from anywhere in the application.

This refactored version provides a more robust and flexible logging setup that can be easily extended or modified as needed.
