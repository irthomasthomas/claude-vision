The refactored code includes the following improvements:

1. Type hinting: Added type annotations to function parameters and return values for better clarity and IDE support.

2. Modularization: Extracted some functionality into separate functions (e.g., `generate_frame_prompt`, `create_frame_result`) to improve readability and maintainability.

3. Consistent naming: Used more consistent and descriptive variable names throughout the code.

4. Asynchronous context manager: Used `async with` for the ThreadPoolExecutor to ensure proper cleanup.

5. List comprehensions: Replaced some for loops with list comprehensions for more concise code.

6. Return structure: Changed the `analyze_video` function to return a dictionary with both metadata and frame results.

7. Optional parameters: Made some parameters optional and added default values where appropriate.

8. Removed TODO comments: Implemented the requested features (analyzing frames independently or as a group, supporting custom prompts and system messages).

These changes make the code more robust, easier to read, and more maintainable. The functionality remains the same, but it's now more flexible and easier to extend in the future.
