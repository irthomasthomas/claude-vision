The refactored code improves the structure and maintainability of the claude_vision package in several ways:

1. Centralized imports: All imports are now in a single file (core.py), which reduces the risk of circular imports and makes it easier to manage dependencies.

2. Improved organization: The imports are grouped into categories, making it easier to understand the structure of the package.

3. Use of type hints: The code now uses type hints for better clarity and to catch potential type-related errors early.

4. Consistent naming: The use of ALL_CAPS for category names and snake_case for function names follows Python naming conventions.

5. Simplified configuration: The individual configuration variables are replaced with a Configuration class, which will make it easier to manage and update settings.

6. Updated exceptions: The base exception is now ClaudeVisionError, which all other custom exceptions should inherit from.

7. Flexible __all__ definition: The __all__ list is now constructed by combining category lists, making it easier to update when new functions or classes are added.

This refactored structure provides a solid foundation for implementing the requested changes, such as updating the CLI, improving error handling, and managing personas. It also makes the package more maintainable and easier to extend in the future.
