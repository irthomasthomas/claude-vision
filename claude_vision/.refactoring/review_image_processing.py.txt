1. Code Structure:
   - Introduced an `ImageSource` enum to categorize different image source types.
   - Created a `ProcessedImage` dataclass to hold processed image data.
   - Separated image type determination and image retrieval into distinct functions.

2. Error Handling:
   - Maintained existing error handling and logging.
   - Centralized error handling in the `process_image_source` function.

3. Type Hinting:
   - Improved type hinting throughout the code for better clarity and IDE support.

4. Async Functionality:
   - Kept the async structure for fetching images and processing multiple images.

5. Image Processing:
   - Maintained existing image processing logic (resizing, format conversion).

6. Performance:
   - The code structure allows for easy parallelization of image processing tasks.

7. Readability:
   - Improved function names and structure for better readability and maintainability.

This refactored version provides a more modular and extensible structure, making it easier to add new image source types or processing steps in the future. The use of enums and dataclasses improves type safety and code organization.
