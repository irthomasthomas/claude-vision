Preface
The present ad quadratum method of generating the regular polyhedra and their study
was developed in the context of the design of the Millennium Sphere project.
The Millennium Sphere was Cooper Union’s submission for an international time-
capsule competition sponsored by the New York Times Magazine. The project was
designed in the spring 1999 semester by Professors Jean Le Mée and Manuel Báez, along
with a team of Cooper Union students. The proposal was chosen as a finalist (honorable
mention) and was included in an exhibition (Dec. 1, 1999-May 31, 2000) at the American
Museum of Natural History in New York City. It was featured in the New York Times
Magazine (Dec. 5, 1999), and shown at the exhibition "Art and Mathematics 2000" at the
Cooper Union (Nov. 7 - Dec. 15, 2000). It is now on permanent exhibition at the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan.
The capsule itself was to have a capacity of between 8 and 27 cubic feet, be watertight,
airtight and have as few seams as possible. It had to be resistant to changes in
temperature, corrosion and pressure. The capsule was to contain a range of printed
materials, photographs and artifacts chosen by the editors of the New York Times
Magazine. Each object would be individually wrapped and sealed in archival boxes and
containers. The capsule should be emptied of oxygen and pumped full of an inert gas
such as argon before being sealed.
The capsule was to protect its content for the next millennium. It was suggested that the
capsule be beautiful enough to be deemed worthy of preservation without at the same
time attracting looters. In any case it should be able to withstand rough treatment.
The capsule had to be located somewhere in Manhattan either in a museum or on “sacred
ground.”
The technical details of the capsule design are available in the project proposal. The
design called for a sealed titanium sphere housed in the center of the Millennium Sphere.
In fact, as explained in the booklet presenting the project and available on the web
(http://www.cooper.edu/sphere.html), three such capsules were proposed, to be located
one in the air, one in the earth, and the other in the crypt of a cathedral under an igneous
rock, all next to the presence, symbolic or real, of water. To fulfill its function of
preservation for a thousand years, the capsule was included into a system that we called
The Millennium Sphere or Ariadne’s Clew.
The Millennium Sphere, also called Ariadne’s Clew, is a memory system to be situated
in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. It is designed not only to hold
selected material in a capsule to be opened in one thousand years as required, but to
perpetuate the knowledge of the existence of the time capsule itself for all that period,
since one of the misfortunes that befalls time capsules is that their location often gets to
be forgotten.

............
The realization of the project results from the interplay of three fundamental elements:
x The millennium sphere proper, holding in its core the sealed material to be
preserved for 1,000 years;
x A marker in the form of a labyrinth, to help the remembrance;
x A ritual to keep the memory alive.
The capsule holds the past, the ritual the present, the marker the future. As holder of the past, the capsule design wants to be, through its structure and
proportions, an embodiment of traditional knowledge such as found in sacred geometry.
We thereby endow it (through this geometric design) with a high esthetic appeal, and
capture the essence of some fundamental ideas, which have given birth to – or sustained
throughout the ages – some of the most profound speculations in philosophy, science, and
religion.


............
The design of the capsule is based on the inner geometry of the five platonic forms,
exhibiting their evolution and growth. What our ad quadratum ex-planation illustrates is
the little-known fact that the entire geometry of the platonic forms results, like the
Pythagorean musical scale, from the simple ratio of the first three integers governing the
values of the angle of any two consecutive diagonals in each of the respective figures –
The internal or Maraldi angle.
From the generating diagram we see a whole compendium of ancient science springing to
life:

The Labyrinth, marker of the site and image of the human condition, reminds us that our
own Minotaur – personal and societal – lies at the center and needs to be dealt with.
The ritual, link between sphere and labyrinth, between heaven and earth, keeps the
memory alive. Every fifty years, the sphere will be brought down to touch the labyrinth
center – heaven on earth but also atom on earth – reminder of the possibilities and risks,
of the promises and atonement marked by the Jubilee year.
In the few weeks available during the course of the project there was no time to elaborate
on the principles and the methods used in the design. A more thorough presentation is
now possible. This possibility and the desire of many viewers to get acquainted with the What it brings out however is a “view from the center” that considerably simplifies and
unifies the understanding of the structure of all regular polyhedra – convex and stellated –
and integrates it quite naturally into a rich tradition of speculative thought be it
geometrical, musical, astronomical or philosophical that has been part of our intellectual
heritage for centuries.
Similar efforts will be dedicated to the labyrinth and the ritual.

Voltaire has Candide say that each man should cultivate his own garden. Though he may
have a point, it is however in digging into my friend Manuel Báez’s Phenomenological
Garden in search of our Millennium Sphere that stellated regular polyhedra started to
grow on me as mistletoe on an apple tree

Ad- Quadratum Construction and Study of

Introduction:
The Ad Quadratum method is a geometric construction for the platonic polyhedra based
on the simple trigonometry of the internal (or Maraldi) angle, i.e., the angle between two
consecutive diagonals in a regular polyhedron1. This trigonometry is based on the ratio
ˆof the first three integers 1, 2, and 3. For example, in a cube, the internal angle Ci is such
1

ˆ ˆthat cos Ci
 (fig. 1A.) For the tetrahedron, cos T i  (fig. 1B); For the octahedron,

 3
2
ˆ ˆ ˆsin O i 1 ; For the dodecahedron, sin D i
 ; and for the icosohedron, tan I i 2 .

Through properties of duality, it is easy to show that the internal angle of one solid are
related to the dihedral angle2 (fig. 1C) of its dual through simple relationships.
ˆ ˆThus the dihedral angle of the cube CD O i , the octahedron internal angle; conversely,
the octahedron dihedral angle O ˆ D S  C ˆ i where C ˆ i is the cube internal angle.
Analogous relationships obtain for all pairs of duals as we shall see later.
The Ad-Quadratum method allows for easy compass and ruler construction of all regular
polyhedra. It yields much more as we shall establish: from the construction of the
Pythagorean triples, the gnomic golden rectangle series, the golden spiral, the exponential
spiral, the tuning of the monochord, and much more. All this based on “the little matter
of distinguishing one, two and three” to use the words of Socrates in The Republic3.

i.e., those pairs of symmetry axes passing through the center of the circumsphere and two adjacent
vertices belonging to the polyhedron under consideration. Mr. James Armstrong of London first drew my
attention to the interest of the internal angles viewpoint.

The dihedral angle is the angle between two intersecting planes (here the adjoining faces) measured
between two lines contained in the planes and mutually perpendicular at a common point to the line of
intersection. On the other hand, the dual or reciprocal of a polyhedron is another polyhedron, the vertices
of which are the centers of the faces of its dual and conversely. Thus cube and octahedron, dodecahedron
and icosahedron are duals of one another while the tetrahedron is its own dual, being self-reciprocating.

Generation of the Platonic Forms:
1. A view from the center
To appreciate the richness of this method, we begin by considering the generation of the
five platonic forms or regular convex polyhedra (fig. 2). The symmetry groups or
patterns of rotations and reflections inherent in these geometric forms are well known.
Nevertheless, the viewpoint tends to remain external: Solids bounded by regular
surfaces4 - a view inherited no doubt from Euclid himself5.
There are, however, other possible viewpoints useful to the designer: either from a
vertex, a face, or in our case, the center of the circumsphere common to the five regular
convex polyhedra.
The move is not unlike Copernicus’ bold step who sat himself on the sun and saw the
complex ptolemaic universe dissolves into a well-ordered ballet of heliocentric orbits.
Taking therefore a central, internal viewpoint, seating ourselves, so to speak, at the center
of our polyhedral universe, we consider the symmetries generated for each platonic form
by the radii issuing from the circumsphere center to two adjacent vertices respectively
(fig. 3).
These lines bursting from the center create by impact on the circumsphere the regular
polyhedra. They delimit within the volume of the sphere regular pyramids with
triangular, square or pentagonal basis as the case may be (fig. 1A, 1B, 3). Each of the
platonic forms is constituted by a bunch of these pyramids (4 for the tetrahedron, with
triangular basis; 6 for the cube, with square basis; 8 for the octahedron with triangular
basis; 12 for the dodecahedron with pentagonal basis; and finally, 20 for the icosahedron
with triangular basis), all with a common apex at the center of the circumsphere.
Together they represent the only five possibilities of dividing Euclidian space equally.
This view of the fivefold division of space allows for a new definition of regularity,
which applies to both convex and stellated polyhedra, as we shall see later.6
A polyhedron, convex or stellated, is regular if:
1.2.all its vertices lie on a common sphere;
the angles between any pair of consecutive radii joining the center of the sphere to
the vertices (the Maraldi angle) are all equal.
4
That is why we prefer to use the word form to that of solid traditionally used because it is more suggestive
of the dependence of the shape of the polyhedra on their internal structure rather than on their external
appearances.

of Greek Mathematics. Dover Pub. New York, 1963, pp. 251-254.

............
...which can be more briefly put as:
To be regular, a polyhedron must be spherical and equimaraldian.
It will be convex if the network of lines (edges) projected on the sphere joining the
vertices is locally planar (i.e., the segments between vertices do not cross). It will be
stellated otherwise.
The well-known duality properties ensure that the vertex radius of one figure is the face
center radius of its dual.
2. Complementary views:
Other viewpoints are, of course, of conceptual interest to the designer. These methods of
generation will be examined subsequently (See Alternative Methods of Generating the
Platonic Forms). We can mention here in passing, the generation of platonic forms as
the result of the interference of the circumsphere with spheres of equal diameter
distributed initially tangentially to the circumsphere along axes corresponding to the radii
perpendicular to the face of the respective polyhedra and being pressed together from all
directions.
Another possibility yet is to start from the six directions of space at a point of origin (i.e.,
a Cartesian system of coordinates) and their afferent octahedron obtained by measuring
equal distances along each axis. Then, along each of these directions, consider another
octahedron as in a crystal like structure, compressing them all towards the center at the
origin, the interferences eventually generate a cube out of which the tetrahedron and the
icosahedron can be generated by very simple construction yielding finally the
dodecahedron.
These methods of generation as well as others will be subsequently examined. At the
present moment, however, we want to concentrate on the internal view and its relation
with the Ad Quadratum method of construction. To this end, we begin by considering
the convex polyhedra in relation to their common circumsphere.
Platonic Forms and Circumsphere:
The relationships between the radius of the circumsphere and the edge of the regular
convex polyhedra have been known since Euclid at least. Theatetus, in the 4th Century
B.C. , is generally credited with the discovery7. Designating by R the radius of the
circumsphere common to all and by a the edge of the respective polyhedra we have:

and Edge Relationships.
